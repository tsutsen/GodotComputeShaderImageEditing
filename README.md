# Editing Images Using Compute Shaders
This is a minimal demo project showcasing the use of a very handy addon [Compute Shader Plus](https://github.com/DevPoodle/compute-shader-plus) for image editing. The sample brightness/contrast shader is adapted from [Lygia](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/lygia).
